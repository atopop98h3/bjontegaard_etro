# ETRO's Bjontegaard Metric implementation for Excel.

## Description:

Excel VBA code for calculating Bjontegaard Delta SNR and Rate, using arbitrary number of data points. The calculated results comply with VCEG-M33 when using 4 data points.

Provides two functions (all arguments take cell ranges):

    BDSNR(BR1, PSNR1, BR2, PSNR2)
    BDBR(BR1, PSNR1, BR2, PSNR2)

These functions are provided in two versions (both containing the exact same VBA code):

1. __bjontegaard_etro_standalone_example.xlsm__ is a stand-alone Excel sheet with the VBA routines internally in the file. Itâ€™s a macro-enabled Excel worksheet.

2. __bjontegaard_etro.xla__ is an Excel Add-In. By adding this on your system (via Excel Add-In preferences), the two functions become globally available in your Excel install.

Note: A C++ implementation is also available as the [Bjontegaard CPP project](https://github.com/tbr/bjontegaard_cpp).
